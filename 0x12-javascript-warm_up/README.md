JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

Scripting (same as we did with Python)
Web front-end

0. First constant, first print
mandatory
Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
You must use console.log(...) to print all output
You are not allowed to use var
